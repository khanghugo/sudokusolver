# sudokusolver
it solves sudoku

I created it without refering to any algorithms solving the sudoku so I am pretty proud of making this. Relatively easy to make as long as you try

the hardest sudoku

grid =[
    [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,7,0,0,9,0,2,0,0],
    [0,5,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,4,5,7,0,0],
    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0],
    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8],
    [0,0,8,5,0,0,0,1,0],
    [0,9,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]]

solved in 6.8s

the algorithm I made here uses another grid to check rather than backtracking so it is not the fastest but I made something
